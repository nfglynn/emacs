HOW TO USE

* Add the following lines to your .emacs file:
  (defun toggle-full-screen () (interactive) (shell-command "emacs_fullscreen.exe"))
  (global-set-key [f11] 'toggle-full-screen)
* Compile main.c (or download compiled EXE from https://bitbucket.org/alexander_manenko/emacs-fullscreen-win32/downloads/emacs_fullscreen.zip) and copy EXE file to the folder in your PATH (I use C:\Windows\system32).
* Now run Emacs and press F11 to switch into full-screen mode. Press F11 again to switch to windowed mode.


This will not hide menu-bar, tool-bar, and scroll-bar. If you want to hide them forever, then use this code:
     (menu-bar-mode -1)
     (tool-bar-mode -1)
     (scroll-bar-mode -1)


If you want to start Emacs in full-screen mode then put call to `toggle-full-screen` function into your .emacs file:
 (toggle-full-screen)


If you want to hide menu-bar, tool-bar, and scroll-bar in full-screen mode and restore them in windowed mode then use this code:
   (defun toggle-full-screen ()
     "Toggles full-screen mode for Emacs window on Win32."
     (interactive)
     (shell-command "emacs_fullscreen.exe"))

   (defun toggle-bars ()
     "Toggles bars visibility."
     (interactive)
     (menu-bar-mode)
     (tool-bar-mode)
     (scroll-bar-mode))

   (defun toggle-full-screen-and-bars ()
     "Toggles full-screen mode and bars."
     (interactive)
     (toggle-bars)
     (toggle-full-screen))

   (global-set-key [f11] 'toggle-full-screen-and-bars)


Here is a part of my .emacs file. Emacs will start in full-screen mode. Menu-bar, tool-bar, and scroll-bar are visible in windowed mode (and are invisible in full-screen mode):
;; Hide splash-screen and startup-message
(setq inhibit-splash-screen t)
(setq inhibit-startup-message t)

(defun toggle-full-screen ()
  "Toggles full-screen mode for Emacs window on Win32."
  (interactive)
  (shell-command "emacs_fullscreen.exe"))

(defun toggle-bars ()
  "Toggles bars visibility."
  (interactive)
  (menu-bar-mode)
  (tool-bar-mode)
  (scroll-bar-mode))

(defun toggle-full-screen-and-bars ()
  "Toggles full-screen mode and bars."
  (interactive)
  (toggle-bars)
  (toggle-full-screen))

;; Use F11 to switch between windowed and full-screen modes
(global-set-key [f11] 'toggle-full-screen-and-bars)

;; Switch to full-screen mode during startup
(toggle-full-screen-and-bars)
