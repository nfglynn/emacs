2002-10-31  Vivek Dasmohapatra  <vivek@etla.org>

	* htmlfontify.el:

	(hfy-face-attr-for-class): rewritten to use a scoring rather
	than a first match algorithm, and to understand that missing
	attributes in the face class don't count as a match or a
	mismatch, ie if we have '((foo bar) (thing moo)) and the face
	doesn't mention thing but has '((foo bar) ...), that's a match.

	(hfy-merge-adjacent-spans): cdrs can now be face attr lists
	as well as face symbols, must use `equal' instead of `eq'.

	(hfy-optimisations): fix error in docs.

	(hfy-facemap-assoc): update docs, cdrs can now be face attr lists.

	(hfy-face-at): overlay faces need not be face attribute lists;
	they can be face symbols or strings ( face names ) as well.

	(hfy-overlay-props-at): overlay props don't always specify a priority

2002-10-30  Vivek Dasmohapatra  <vivek@etla.org>

	* htmlfontify.el:

	- cache names for temporary fonts generated by overlays.

	- add hfy-optimisations entry: should we pay attention to overlays?

	- work out names for overlay temporary fonts.

	- if the tunable is set, overlays are combined with the font in
	  effect at a point to produce a "temporary font": This allows
	  htmlfontify to capture ediff or goo-font-lock style highlights.

2002-06-30  Vivek Dasmohapatra  <vivek@etla.org>

	* htmlfontify.el:

	- Comments (re)moved to changelog, they were cluttering up the source.

	* htmlfontify.el:

	- add optional <div class="default"> </div> wrapper around output

	- updated texinfo file.
    
2002-06-02 Vivek Dasmohapatra  <vivek@etla.org>

	* htmlfontify.el:

	- fixed `hfy-etag-regex' and `hfy-parse-tags-buffer' to cope w.
	  duff lines. ( eg when GNU etags scans a plain text file and
	  generates bad tag entries, for some value of bad ).

	- automatically interpolate the value of `hfy-etags-bin' into
	  `hfy-etags-cmd' before use. ( Required manual intervention before. )
  
2002-05-19 Vivek Dasmohapatra  <vivek@etla.org>

	* htmlfontify.el:

	- separate the preparation of certain buffers from their use: this

	  htmlisation to them anyway.

	- fix bug in face-map harvesting of unfontified files.  

	- generate balanced pairs of <a href=...>|</a> tags ( by ignoring
	  out-of-sequence or otherwise superfluous link|endl properties ).

	* htmlfontify.el:

	- added defcustom entry to skip refontification of buffer

	* htmlfontify.el:

	- Added ability to suppress hyperlinks in blocks highlighted as
	  strings and/or comments.

	- Tags beginning with non-alnum characters are now hyperlinked
	  properly ( also stops C++ destructors trampling the linking of
	  constructors or <_name>'s links stomping on <name>'s ).

2002-02-14  Vivek Dasmohapatra  <vivek@etla.org>

	* 0.10: (released)

	* htmlfontify.el:

	- Fixed bug in harvesting of some face attributes.

	  is a special case if we have set `hfy-display-class'.
	  
	- Added style entry for body element, with style values from the
	  default face. ( Was using hardwired values ( that I happen to

2002-02-09  Vivek Dasmohapatra  <vivek@etla.org>

	* 0.08: (released)
	
	* htmlfontify.el:

	- was getting <span><a>foo</span></a> overlaps, should be fixed now...
	
2002-02-08  Vivek Dasmohapatra  <vivek@etla.org>

	* 0.07: (released)

	* htmlfontify.el;

	- import into scm system

	- Added GPL headers
	
	* 0.06: (not released)

	* htmlfontify.el;

	- dummy up a bogus `window-system' to make `cperl-mode' do a full
	  highlighting run thingy ( it doesn't call `defface' when if it
	  thinks there's no display ) ow, my sentences are starting to not
	  be parseable, sleep may be advisable. curse this frail body...

	* 0.05: (not released)

	* htmlfontify.el;

	- add ability to split index page out alphabetically + defcustom to
	  control this behaviour. (off by default).

	- Force fontification even more in batch mode. ( Need to dummy
	  up the marker `font-lock-cache-position' so it won't blow up ).

	* 0.04: (not released)

	* htmlfontify.el;

	- Add ability to fontify as if in a display class other than the
	  one we are connected to. Hopefully this will allow ( for example )
	  X-style fontification when running in batch mode or on a tty, or
	  light-background fontification when we have a dark background
	  emacs setup ( for publishing to white bg web pages ).
	
	* 0.03: (not released)

	* htmlfontify.el;

	- If there are multiple definitions of a tag within a file (eg proto
	  and decl, or multiple method impl's), they now all get marked with
	  #tag anchors (we had a last match wins case before)

 	- If a tag is both an anchor and a link, we now mark it as both:
	  Didn't do this before because I was afraid of overlapping start-0
	  start-1 stop-0 stop-1 effects, but the code seems to cope Ok.

	- Ok, we should force fontification, and suppress saving of .flc
	  files ( by default, customisable ) now.
	
	* 0.02: (not released)

	* htmlfontify.el;
	
	- at proposed deb maintainers req, make it work on emacs20

	- removed all references to [:xdigit:] and {N} in regexen,
	  emacs20 doesn't seem to understand them.

	- emacs20 version seems much slower than emacs21 version, not
	  unexpected.	      

	* hfy-cmap.el:  
	    
        - add fallback colour name -> triplet code for when we aren't
	  running in X. (not useful yet, but if we can force the code
	  to use the X face specs even when on console, this will be handy)

	* 0.01: first semi-clean version - debian package candidate
